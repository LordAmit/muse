# Muse
Muse (alternatively ÂµSE) is a mutation-based soundness evaluation framework which systematically evaluates Android static analysis tools to discover, document, and fix, flaws, by leveraging the well-founded practice of mutation analysis. More information about Muse can be found in our [USENIX Security'18 paper](http://www.cs.wm.edu/~rfbonett/pubs/usenix18.pdf) and on our [website](https://muse-security-evaluation.github.io/#overview). 

This repository is a refactoring of the original Muse tool written by Richie Bonnett, done as a part of W&M's Software Engineering course, CSCI 435, year 2019.

# Compilation
The source code of Muse is available in [Code](https://gitlab.com/WM-CSCI435-F18/android-muse/tree/master/code) section of this repository. It is maintained using the open source Eclipse Java IDE. To compile, simply clone this repo, and then import the project as a Java project in Eclipse.

# Pre compiled Binary
Alternatively, you can use the Muse.jar file by downloading it from the releases section. 

# Usage
Muse relies on [MDroidPlus](https://gitlab.com/SEMERU-Code-Public/Android/Mutation/MDroidPlus). You will need the `libs4ast` folder of that project in order to run Muse. 

To run Muse, use the following command, specifying the arguments. `(arg)` specifies required arguments and `[arg]` specifies optional arguments:
```
java -jar Muse-1.0.0.jar (<libs4ast>) (<AppSourceCode>) (<AppName>) (<OutputPath>) (<OperatorType>) [-d <LeakFile>]
```

If running Muse within a IDE like Eclipse, import only the Muse folder within the code subdirectory, or else you might get a java.lang.SecurityException error when running Muse.java

### Arguments
Provide the following list of required arguments when running Muse: 
1. ``libs4ast``:  Path of the lib4ast folder, from [MDroidPlus](https://gitlab.com/SEMERU-Code-Public/Android/Mutation/MDroidPlus/tree/master/libs4ast);
2. ``AppSourceCode``: Path of the Android app source code folder, which you want to apply mutation on;
3. ``AppName``:  Name of the App;
4. ``Output``: Path of the folder where the mutants will be created;
5. `OperatorType`: Type of operator to be used while creating mutants. Currently supported arguments are: TAINTSOURCE, TAINTSINK, SCOPESOURCE, REACHABILITY, SCOPESINK, and COMPLEXREACHABILITY.
6. ``-d LeakFile``:  Option flag and path of the custom data leak definition file
 

### Example
```
java -jar Muse-1.0.0.jar MDroidPlus/libs4ast/ /tmp/AppFoo/src/ AppFoo /tmp/mutants/ SCOPESINK
```

This will create a folder called `AppFoo` under `/tmp/mutants` where the mutated source files will be stored. 

```
java -jar Muse-1.0.0.jar MDroidPlus/libs4ast/ /tmp/AppFoo/src/ AppFoo /tmp/mutants/ REACHABILITY -d /tmp/dataLeak.txt
```

This will execute REACHABILITY in Muse with a custom data leak string defined in `tmp/dataLeak.txt`

### Defining a Custom Data Leak String
Muse allows the user to define their own custom data leak string to be used in the execution of Muse. The dataLeak.txt file should be formatted as follows:

```
"CUSTOM_SOURCE_LEAK_STRING"
"CUSTOM_SINK_LEAK_STRING"
```

The first line of the Leak file should define the custom source and the second line should define the custom sink. If either line is empty, meaning no custom leak is defineed, Muse will use it's default leak strings. If no file is specified, Muse will also use it's defualt leak strings.


# Muse Processor Helper Utility
We have created the Muse processor utility using python, which makes it easier to mutate android projects by generating relevant shell script files. To work with it, you need to replace the file paths, and edit the file called `input_folders`. In the file, you need to provide the list of directories containing Android projects. The provided `input_folders` already contains sample values.

# Future Work
Currently Muse is oriented towards the evaluation of static analysis tools for Android data leak detection. We intend to expand Muse by developing additional security operators and mutation schemes for tools with other goals, e.g. SSL verification. 

This repository is for a refactoring and expansion of the original muse tool built by Richie Bonnett.
